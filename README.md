# Overview

This is an experimental project based on the X-COM lite RTS tutorial by Code Monkey on gamedev.tv.  I'm maintaining here so I can reference the code during other projects and for memory.

This code will differ greatly from the root tutorial in many cases as I seek my own implementation and experiment.

I will also drift considerably to experiment with some gamplay concepts.
